NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline solved examples
-----------------------------------------

This is a repository of stereo datasets, together with processing recipes and produced terrain models using the [NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline). The goal is to have a handful of representative and self-contained examples to give users a chance to practice running the tools. For more examples, see the [documentation](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

## Two-image stereo

  * [ASTER](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipelineSolvedExamples/releases/tag/ASTER) - a good introductory example for creating terrain models with publicly available Earth images and RPC cameras.
  * [Dawn](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipelineSolvedExamples/releases/tag/DawnFC) - a small and simple example using the Dawn Framing Camera with images of asteroid Vesta.
  * [LRO NAC](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipelineSolvedExamples/releases/tag/LRONAC) - an example for the Moon using the LRO NAC linescan camera.
  * [LRO WAC](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipelineSolvedExamples/releases/tag/LROWAC) - an example for the Moon using the LRO WAC pushframe camera.
  * [Mini-RF](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipelineSolvedExamples/releases/tag/MiniRF) - a more exotic example for the Moon using the Mini-RF Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument.
  
## Rig calibration

 * [Rig calibrator](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipelineSolvedExamples/releases/tag/rig_calibrator) - an example of using the rig_calibrator program in ASP to calibrate a rig of three cameras.
